# Booking App

## Summary
The Booking App is a web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Appwrite. It allows users to book meeting or conference rooms, manage bookings, and authenticate users. 

The app provides pages for user registration, login, room management, and booking details. Admins can add rooms, while users can view available rooms and their bookings. The app uses Appwrite for backend services, including authentication and data storage.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Landing page.
- **Login & Register**: User authentication.
- **Sign Out**: Logs the user out.
- **Room Management**: View, add, and manage rooms.
- **Booking Details**: View and manage bookings.
- **404 Page**: Handles unknown routes.
- **No Data & Loading Pages**: Shows appropriate messages when no data or loading is present.

## Tech Stack
- **Next.js**: React framework for server-rendered apps.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for JavaScript.
